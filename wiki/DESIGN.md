# Structured Wiki Service — Design Document

> Status: **Draft / living document** · Last updated: 2026-06-03 · Owner: @benjamin

> A TypeScript-only, embeddable wiki engine. Pages are **structured, LLM-first documents**

> Pages live in a **workspace** — a graph of pages that is the unit of atomic consistency and

## 1. Motivation & goals

We want a wiki that an LLM agent (and a handful of collaborating humans) can author and evolve
**safely and reproducibly**. Free-text wikis are a poor fit for autonomous agents: anything
can be overwritten, contradictions creep in, and meaning drifts. Instead:

- **The shape of every page is known.** Pages are typed documents (a "Feature brief", an
  "Implementation plan", a "Testing plan"), not blobs of prose — and their content is a **tree of
  typed Sections** with closed, engine-owned **field-kinds** (structured-content §2–§3), addressable
  by `(section, field)` so tools operate on structure directly.
- **Pages change only through named operations** with **typed arguments and return values** —
  `addConstraint({ text })`, `answerQuestion({ questionId, answer })` — never a
  `setBody(markdown)`. Every such command's effect is a **closed, engine-owned section operation**
  (structured-content §9.4); there are no per-type events or author-written reducers.
- **Lifecycle is enforced, not suggested.** Each page and certain sub-entities have a
  **status** governed by an explicit **finite state machine**; a mutation is legal only where
  the FSM declares a transition. Once a question is `resolved`, nothing answers it again.
- **Pages form a graph inside a workspace**, and structural changes (reparenting, reordering,
  linking) — *plus cross-page content moves* — are **atomic**, because a workspace is a single
  event-sourced aggregate.
- **History is the source of truth** (event sourcing): audit, time-travel, replay, and a
  natural fit for agent loops.
- **Rendering is deterministic:** equal state always renders to byte-identical Markdown.

### Goals

- **G1 — Transport-free public API.** `wiki/` exposes *only* a TypeScript interface — no HTTP,
  no CLI (those are downstream packages). It *consumes* a Durable Streams server over HTTP for
  storage ([§9](#9-persistence-with-durable-streams)) but surfaces none of that.
- **G2 — Structured mutations with static + runtime types.** Every mutation has a compile-time
  signature *and* a runtime schema (LLM-generated arguments are validated).
- **G3 — FSM-gated lifecycle.** A status mutation is permitted **iff** the FSM declares a
  transition from the current status (self-transitions included).
- **G4 — Workspace = one event-sourced Durable Stream.** The workspace (a graph of pages) is
  the aggregate and the unit of atomic consistency. Storage durability (in-memory / file /
  ACID) is a *Durable Streams server* setting, not a wiki concern.
- **G5 — Atomic structural & cross-page operations.** Reparent, reorder, link, and cross-page
  content moves are all-or-nothing within a workspace.
- **G6 — One tail, all updates.** A reader subscribes to a single workspace stream and sees
  every page + structure change, in order.
- **G7 — Deterministic Markdown rendering** of any page or the whole workspace tree.
- **G8 — LLM-native ergonomics:** discoverable command catalog, JSON-Schema export for
  tool/function-calling, "only legal actions are offered," structured/actionable errors.

---

## 2. Non-goals

- **No HTTP / network interface *exposed* by `wiki/`.** It *uses* the Durable Streams client to
  reach storage but exposes no network surface. The durable host it *connects to* is a separate
  package, `wiki-server/` — a stream host, **not** an API over the engine (`wiki-server/DESIGN.md`).
- **No CLI in `wiki/`.** (See `wiki-cli/` future package.)
- **No *free-form* rich text.** Content is a tree of typed Sections with closed field-kinds; prose
  lives inside *typed* fields (a `prose` field, or the `blocks` document model), never an opaque
  Markdown/HTML body. ***Structured* rich text is supported** — the `blocks` field-kind is a closed
  vocabulary of typed, `id`-bearing block/inline nodes rendered by identity (structured-content
  §3.1, §13); what's excluded is the opaque blob and any `html`/`raw`/`markdown` block.
- **No cross-*workspace* atomicity.** Consistency is per-workspace (one stream). Moving a page
  between workspaces is a non-atomic export/import (a saga), accepted as rare. *Within* a
  workspace, everything is atomic.
- **No general-purpose query language** in v1. Reads are "open a workspace," "load a page,"
  "walk the tree." Richer cross-workspace projections are [future work](#18-future-work).
- **Not a CRDT / not offline-merge.** We assume one logical writer per workspace at a time and
  resolve the occasional concurrent write with optimistic concurrency
  ([§15](#15-concurrency-idempotency--ordering)).

## 3. Background research

### 3.1 `typescript-fsm` (design reference — **not** a dependency)

Source: <https://github.com/WebLegions/typescript-fsm> (`src/stateMachine.ts`). A tiny,
dependency-free FSM. Relevant surface:

```ts
export interface ITransition<STATE, EVENT, CALLBACK> { fromState: STATE; event: EVENT; toState: STATE; cb: CALLBACK; }
export function t<STATE, EVENT, CALLBACK>(fromState, event, toState, cb?): ITransition;

export class StateMachine<STATE, EVENT, CALLBACK> {
  constructor(init: STATE, transitions?: ITransition[], logger?: ILogger);
  getState(): STATE;
  can(event: EVENT): boolean;                  // is a transition defined from current state?
  getNextState(event: EVENT): STATE | undefined;
  isFinal(): boolean;
  addTransitions(transitions: ITransition[]): void;
  dispatch<E extends EVENT>(event: E, ...args): Promise<void>;  // async, runs cb
  toMermaid(title?: string): string;
}
```

**Reference only — we do not depend on it.** We borrow two ideas — the declarative
transition-table shape (`t(fromState, event, toState)` / `ITransition`) and the pure
`can` / `getNextState` lookups — and reimplement them in ~20 lines
([§7.2](#72-our-own-guard-a-tiny-transition-table)). Taking the dependency would mean importing
a stateful, enum-oriented, single-machine-instance library only to call its trivial pure
methods, while shunning its headline API, `dispatch()` — which is a footgun here: it mutates
`_current` *before* running the callback and does **not** roll back on async failure (only
`SyncStateMachine` reverts), firing via `setTimeout(…,0)`. Owning the code is cleaner and lets
us model multiple FSM levels (workspace/page/item), self-transitions, per-transition metadata
for the LLM tool catalog, and a tailored `toMermaid()`. The event log — not any FSM's
`_current` — is our source of truth for status.

### 3.2 Durable Streams (the persistence substrate)

Concepts: <https://durablestreams.com/concepts> · Client: `@durable-streams/client` (npm
~v0.2.x) · Server: `@durable-streams/server` · By ElectricSQL, Dec 2025. Tagline: **"the data
primitive for the agent loop."**

- A **stream** is an *append-only, durable, strictly-ordered* sequence at its own URL. In
  **JSON mode** each POST stores one message; **POSTing an array stores each element as its own
  message**, and a GET returns a JSON array for the requested range.
- **Offsets** are *opaque, lexicographically-sortable string tokens*; reads resume from a saved
  offset. **Live tailing** via long-poll or SSE.
- **Storage is a *server* setting:** in-memory (default), file-backed (log files + LMDB), or
  ACID (redb). `@durable-streams/server`'s `DurableStreamTestServer` is built for "development,
  testing, CI, and embedding in a Node.js application"; production via a Caddy plugin or
  Electric Cloud.

Three findings that directly shape this design ([details + sources](#19-references)):

1. **Atomicity is per-stream, and a multi-event append is atomic.** Servers "SHOULD commit
   producer state updates and log appends atomically," and a writer can "atomically append a
   final message and close in a single operation." There is **no cross-stream transaction.**
   → *To change multiple pages atomically, they must be in the same stream.* A command's events
   are written as **one atomic POST of a JSON array.**
2. **Conditional append / optimistic concurrency is native.** StreamFS reports "stale-write
   detection via `PreconditionFailedError`," and the producer model carries epoch/sequence
   preconditions. → We get `expectedVersion` enforcement for free.
3. **StreamFS precedent (the hybrid we did *not* pick).** StreamFS — "a reactive agent
   filesystem in a stream" — keeps the **tree/structure in one metadata stream** and **file
   content in per-file streams** (`/_metadata` + `/_content/{id}`), so `move`/`rename` is atomic
   (structure-only). We instead put the *whole workspace* (structure **and** content) in one
   stream, because we need atomic **cross-page content** moves and a single tail for all
   updates — see [ADR-002](../docs/wiki/decision-records/workspace-as-the-aggregate-one-stream.md).

**The client (illustrative; the `EventLog` mapping lives in [§9.1](#91-one-stream-per-workspace)):**

```ts
import { DurableStream, IdempotentProducer, stream } from "@durable-streams/client";

const handle = await DurableStream.create({ url, contentType: "application/json", ttlSeconds });
const res = await stream<MyEvent>({ url, offset, live: false });   // live: true|false|"sse"|"long-poll"
const items = await res.json();
const unsub = res.subscribeJson(async (batch) => { /* batch.items; save batch offset to resume */ });
const producer = new IdempotentProducer(handle, "producer-id", { autoClaim: true, onError });
producer.append(event); await producer.flush(); await producer.close();
```

## 4. Core concepts & vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Workspace** | A graph of pages and **the aggregate** — the unit of atomic consistency. Maps to **one Durable Stream**. |
| **Page** | A typed wiki document, modeled as an **entity inside a workspace** (not its own stream). Has a status FSM and a tree of typed **Sections** (structured-content §2). |
| **Section** | The **one content container** inside a page: an ordered, stable-id-bearing, addressable node of typed **fields** that may nest. Sections have **no FSM** (structured-content §2). |
| **Field-kind** | The closed, engine-owned vocabulary naming how a field's value is shaped, validated, and rendered: `scalar` / `prose` / `code` / `attachment-ref` / `ref` / `blocks` / `list` (structured-content §3). |
| **Tree** | Two levels: the **workspace tree** of pages (`parentId` on the page) and the **intra-page section tree** (`parentId` on the section). Both are ordered and acyclic. |
| **Link** | A typed, non-hierarchical cross-reference between two pages in the workspace (`from`, `to`, `role`), forming the graph beyond the tree. (Distinct from a `ref` field — an intra-content typed cross-reference, structured-content §3.) |
| **Page type** | A reusable, **declarative** definition (e.g. `feature-brief`): sections + field-kinds, element (list-item) types + their FSMs, the status FSM, commands, structural contracts, and render config. It declares **no** reducer and **no** renderer — both are engine-owned (structured-content §9). |
| **Status** | A page's (or list element's, or the workspace's) current FSM state. Sections have none. |
| **Element (list item)** | A typed sub-entity held inside a `list` field, optionally with its own status FSM (e.g. `question: open → resolved`). The only place a sub-entity carries lifecycle (structured-content §3, §9.3). |
| **Mutation / Command** | A named, typed operation whose effect is a **closed section-operation** vocabulary. **Structural** (workspace-scoped: createPage, reparent, reorder, link, moveItem…) or **content/status** (page-scoped, FSM- and write-gate-gated). |
| **Section operation** | The closed, engine-owned vocabulary every content command's effect is expressed in (`setField`, `addSection`/…/`renameSection`, `addBlock`/…/`setBlock`, `addElement`/…/`setElementField`, `applyTextEdits`, `setMeta`, `transition`) — folded by one built-in reducer (structured-content §9.4). |
| **Event** | An immutable fact appended to the workspace stream; folded to derive state. A content event carries a **generic section operation**; the originating command name lives in metadata. Carries the `pageId` it affects (if any). |
| **Reducer / `apply`** | The single, **engine-owned** pure `(workspaceState, event) => workspaceState` that folds section operations. There are **no per-type, author-written reducers** (the one author seam is a bounded meta-scoped `reduceMeta`, structured-content §9.5). |
| **EventLog** | The single module that talks to Durable Streams (events↔messages, version↔offset, OCC). |

**Unifying principle (G3):** *every status mutation is an FSM transition* — including
self-transitions for content edits that don't change status (`draft —addConstraint→ draft`).
**Structural/relational rules** (acyclic page tree, parent exists, unique sibling title, link target
exists, acyclic section tree, `ref`-target exists, section-set contracts) are **invariants** checked
in command handlers / the well-formedness check, not status transitions.

```

*Strict CQRS: the **Command Bus** drives the write-side **decide-aggregate** (fold → `Committed<T>`);
a **separate Read Model** (default in-memory `IReadModel`, fed by the live tail, token-gated —
[§8.4](#84-live-projection)/[§8.6](#86-consistency-tokens-read-models--cqrs)) serves all reads and
the Markdown renderer.*

**Command lifecycle (the hot path):**

1. **Resolve** the write-side decide-aggregate (from snapshot + folded tail, or a live-maintained
   cache); reads instead come from the read model ([§8.6](#86-consistency-tokens-read-models--cqrs)).
2. **Validate** the command's arguments against its schema (runtime).
3. **Guard:** status commands → ask the target entity's (page/element) FSM `can(status, command)`;
   content commands → also check the target's **write-gate** (`mutableIn`) and the section-set
   contract; structural commands → check invariants (parent exists, no cycle, link/`ref` target
   exists, …); run any transition **preconditions** and the **well-formedness check** against the
   resulting sections. Failure → `MutationNotAllowedError` / a typed structural / invariant error.
4. **Decide:** map the command **declaratively** to a list of **section operations** (target +
   args→field mapping + transition + preconditions), or — for a computed effect — run its pure
   `produces(state, args, ctx)` escape hatch, which returns section operations (never bespoke
   events) + a typed **result** ([structured-content §9.4](../docs/structured-content.md)). Each
   operation is wrapped in a generic content event whose metadata records the originating command.
5. **Append** the events as **one atomic POST** with `expectedVersion = foldedHead`. On
   `PreconditionFailedError` → **rebase-and-retry** ([§15](#15-concurrency-idempotency--ordering)).
6. **Fold** the events through the **one engine-owned reducer** into the write-side decide-aggregate,
   update the cache, and **return
   `Committed<T>` — the result *plus* a `ConsistencyToken`** for the committed head `version`
   (after the append **and** any OCC rebase-retry; an idempotent/zero-event write returns the
   current head). Every write returns `Committed<T>` — including the structural commands that
   were `void` ([§6.2](#62-workspace--the-aggregate-stream-root), [§10.3](#103-the-iworkspacehandle-interface-one-workspace--the-aggregate)).

Steps 2–4 are pure; only step 5 touches the outside world. The fold above maintains the **write
side** (FSM/invariants/OCC); **reads are served from a separate, token-gated read model** fed by
the live tail ([§8.6](#86-consistency-tokens-read-models--cqrs)), not from this fold — strict
CQRS, eventual consistency. A read may carry the returned token to wait for read-your-writes.

## 6. Domain model: the workspace aggregate & its entities

### 6.1 One consistency aggregate, several modeled types

In event-sourcing terms there is exactly **one consistency aggregate — the Workspace** —
because a single stream's append is the only atomic unit Durable Streams offers
([§3.2](#32-durable-streams-the-persistence-substrate), [ADR-002](../docs/wiki/decision-records/workspace-as-the-aggregate-one-stream.md)),
and the operations that must be atomic span multiple pages:

- **Structural:** reparent a page, reorder siblings, add/remove a link — must keep the tree
  acyclic and referentially intact.
- **Cross-page content:** e.g. *move an open question from one page to another* — two pages change
  together.

Both require the affected pages to live in the **same stream**, so the **Workspace is the
aggregate (one stream)** and **Pages and Items are entities within it**. (Bonus: one stream =
one tail for all updates — G6.)

Sharing a stream does **not** mean modeling them vaguely. But — a deliberate shift in this model —
a type is **declarative**: it specifies its **identity, lifecycle FSM, sections + field-kinds,
element (list-item) types + their FSMs, commands, structural contracts, and render config**, and it
declares **neither a reducer nor a renderer** — those are engine-owned and uniform across every type
([structured-content §9](../docs/structured-content.md)). The full catalog:

| Type | Role | Own stream? | Identity | Lifecycle FSM | Mutated by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Workspace** | the aggregate / stream root | **yes** — 1 per workspace | `WorkspaceId` | `active → archived` | structural commands ([§6.2](#62-workspace--the-aggregate-stream-root)) |
| **Page** (per page type) | entity in the workspace | no (shares the stream) | `PageId`, type-prefixed | per page type ([§6.3](#63-page--an-entity-one-spec-per-page-type)) | page-scoped commands |
| **Section** | content container inside a page | no | `SectionId` (engine-minted) + stable `key` | **none** | content commands (gated by `mutableIn`) |
| **Element** (per element type) | list item inside a `list` field | no | element id, scoped to its page | per element type ([§6.4](#64-element--a-list-item-one-spec-per-element-type)) | content commands targeting the list |

> **Terminology.** We reserve **aggregate** for the consistency/stream boundary (the Workspace).
> Pages and list **Elements** are **entities**; a **Section** is structure within a page, not an
> entity with a lifecycle (it has no FSM). If you think of a page or element as "the Page aggregate"
> / "the Question aggregate," read that as *the entity's self-contained declarative spec* (its
> sections/FSM/commands/contracts) — it shares the workspace's stream and the engine's one reducer
> rather than owning either. Promoting any of them to its own stream would reopen
> [ADR-002](../docs/wiki/decision-records/workspace-as-the-aggregate-one-stream.md) and forfeit atomic
> cross-page operations.

### 6.2 Workspace — the aggregate (stream root)

**Identity** `WorkspaceId` · **Stream** `{baseUrl}/{namespace}/workspace/{id}` · **Status FSM**
`active → archived` (archival blocks further mutations).

**State (the fold target):**

A page's content is a **tree of typed Sections**, not a `fields`/`items` pair. The state shapes
below are the engine view; [structured-content §2–§3](../docs/structured-content.md) is the
authoritative shape for `ISection` / `IField` / `IBlock` / `IItem` and the closed field-kinds.

```ts
type WorkspaceId = string & { readonly __brand: "WorkspaceId" };
type PageId      = string & { readonly __brand: "PageId" };
type SectionId   = string & { readonly __brand: "SectionId" };

interface IWorkspaceState {
  id: WorkspaceId;
  name: string;
  status: "active" | "archived";                 // workspace-lifecycle FSM
  pages: Map<PageId, IPageNode>;                   // every page by id
  children: Map<PageId | "@root", PageId[]>;      // ordered children → the page tree
  links: { from: PageId; to: PageId; role: string }[];  // graph edges beyond the tree
  version: number;                                // per-workspace, == stream length
}

interface IPageNode {
  id: PageId;
  type: string;                  // "feature-brief"
  parentId: PageId | null;       // null = top-level (child of @root)
  title: string;                 // denormalized into the node (sibling-uniqueness + nav)
  status: string;                // page-type FSM status
  sections: ISection[];          // ordered; the page's content tree (the ONE content container)
  createdAt: string; updatedAt: string;
}

// Sections, fields, blocks, and list elements (items) — authoritative shapes in structured-content §2–§3.
interface ISection {
  key: string;                       // stable, model-declared; unique among siblings (addressing)
  id: SectionId;                     // engine-minted (injected newId)
  name: string; description?: string;
  order: number;                     // explicit ordering — never object-key order
  parentId: SectionId | null;        // the intra-page section tree (may nest)
  fields: Record<string, IField>;    // keyed by fieldKey; values are field-kinds (below)
  meta?: Record<string, unknown>;    // typed model-defined auxiliary data (§9.5 there)
}

type IField =
  | { kind: "scalar";         value: string | number | boolean }
  | { kind: "prose";          value: string }
  | { kind: "code";           lang: string; source: string; hash: string }
  | { kind: "attachment-ref"; ref: string; mime: string; name: string }
  | { kind: "ref";            target: RefTarget }      // typed cross-reference; render-derived label
  | { kind: "blocks";         blocks: IBlock[] }       // the DOCUMENT field-kind (structured-content §3.1)
  | { kind: "list";           elementType: string; elements: IItem[] };  // homogeneous; elements may carry a model FSM

// A list element ("item") — the only sub-entity that carries lifecycle.
interface IItem { id: string; status?: string; fields: Record<string, IField>; meta?: Record<string, unknown>; }
```

`code` stores **canonical source** (`{ lang, source, hash }`), never an AST — ASTs are read-side
projections in the host ([structured-content §4](../docs/structured-content.md)). The section tree
lives within the page's slice of the workspace stream: it introduces **no new stream or consistency
boundary** and inherits the workspace's OCC/aggregate guarantees.

**Structural commands** (workspace-scoped; guarded by invariants + "workspace active?" +
"target page not archived?"). **Every command also yields a `ConsistencyToken`** for the
committed head: the `Result` column below is the `value` carried inside `Committed<value>`, and
the `—` rows return `Committed<void>` (the token still names where the events landed, so an agent
can read the mutated graph back — [§8.6](#86-consistency-tokens-read-models--cqrs)):

| Command | Args | Events (one atomic append) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `createPage` | `{ type, title, parentId }` | `PageCreated` (+ the page type's create event) | `PageId` |
| `reparent` | `{ pageId, newParentId, position? }` | `PageReparented`, `ChildrenReordered` | — |
| `reorder` | `{ parentId, orderedChildIds }` | `ChildrenReordered` | — |
| `setPageTitle` | `{ pageId, title }` | `PageTitleSet` | — |
| `archivePage` | `{ pageId }` | `PageArchived` | — |
| `unarchivePage` | `{ pageId }` | `PageUnarchived` | — |
| `link` / `unlink` | `{ from, to, role }` | `LinkAdded` / `LinkRemoved` | — |
| `moveItem` | `{ from, to, section, field, itemId }` | a `removeElement` + an `addElement` section operation, both in one atomic append (the cross-page move precedent, structured-content §5) | — |
| `archiveWorkspace` *(handle: `archive()`)* | `{}` | `WorkspaceArchived` | — |

> Content events are **generic section operations** (structured-content §9.4), not per-`<Item>`
> event types: a cross-page element move appends one `removeElement` on the source page and one
> `addElement` on the destination, attributed to the `moveItem` command in metadata. The
> "`<Item>Removed`+`<Item>Added`" pairing is retired with the per-type event model.

Every stream's first event is `WorkspaceCreated { name }`.

**Invariants enforced atomically (the payoff):**

- **Acyclic page tree** — `reparent(p, newParent)` rejects if `newParent` is `p` or a descendant
  (`CycleError`). The **intra-page section tree** reuses the same acyclic/ordering invariants
  (structured-content §2).
- **Parent / page exists** (`ParentNotFoundError`, `PageNotFoundError`).
- **Unique title among siblings** (optional per workspace; `DuplicateTitleError`).
- **Link integrity** — both link endpoints exist (`LinkTargetNotFoundError`); likewise a `ref`
  field/inline-`ref` target must resolve (dangling references rejected, structured-content §7).
- **Section-set & well-formedness** — required sections exist, the section-set contract
  (open/closed, prohibited, cardinality) holds, and the resulting sections parse against their
  declared field schemas (structured-content §6) — checked in `decide` so they re-run on every
  OCC rebase.
- **Atomic cross-page edits** — `moveItem` is all-or-nothing (the `removeElement`+`addElement`
  operations in one append, never half-moved).

### 6.3 Page — an entity (one spec per page type)

A page is an `IPageNode` whose content is a tree of Sections; its content and status change only via
the **page type's** own commands. `definePageType(...)` is the full **declarative** entity spec
([§10.5](#105-authoring-api-defining-page-and-element-types), [structured-content §9](../docs/structured-content.md)):

- **Identity** `PageId`, type-prefixed (e.g. `feature-brief:01J…`).
- **Sections + field-kinds** — the page's section layout: each section's typed fields (by
  field-kind), whether it is `required`, and the statuses in which it is mutable (`mutableIn`).
- **Element (list-item) types** — declared in `elements`; a `list` field holds elements of one
  declared type, which may carry a status FSM.
- **Status FSM** — the page lifecycle, with self-transitions for content edits that don't change
  status.
- **Commands** — page-scoped, FSM- and write-gate-gated; invoked `ws.mutate(pageId, command, args)`.
  **Declarative by default** (target + args→field mapping + transition + preconditions); the
  `produces` escape hatch returns **section operations** for a computed effect.
- **Structural contracts** — `requiredSections`, the section-set shape, per-field `required`/schema,
  `mutableIn` write-gates, transition `preconditions` ([§6.6 there](../docs/structured-content.md)).
- **Render config** — declarative, logic-free presentation ([§11](#11-deterministic-markdown-rendering)).
- **No reducer, no renderer, no per-type events** — the fold, the section-operation vocabulary, and
  the Markdown render read model are **engine-owned and uniform**. The one author fold-seam is a
  bounded, meta-scoped `reduceMeta` (structured-content §9.5).
- **Required children** (optional) — page types in `requiredChildren` are auto-created
  *atomically* with the page and pinned (can't be reparented out or archived alone); e.g.
  `feature-brief` mandates an implementation plan, checklist, and testing plan
  ([§13](#13-worked-example-an-llm-plans-and-ships-a-feature)). (Distinct from `requiredSections`,
  which auto-materializes empty *sections within* a page, structured-content §6.)

**Registered page types (v1):**

| Page type | Status FSM | List-element types | Full spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature-brief` *(top-level; mandates 3 child pages)* | `draft → planning → building → review → shipped` (+ `abandoned`) | `component`, `constraint`, `question`, `commit` | [§13](#13-worked-example-an-llm-plans-and-ships-a-feature) |
| `implementation-plan` | `draft → ready` | `step`, `question` | [§13](#13-worked-example-an-llm-plans-and-ships-a-feature) |
| `implementation-checklist` | `building → complete` | `task` | [§13](#13-worked-example-an-llm-plans-and-ships-a-feature) |
| `testing-plan` | `draft → ready` | `case` | [§13](#13-worked-example-an-llm-plans-and-ships-a-feature) |
| *(future)* `adr`, `spec`, `risk`, `experiment`, … | per type | per type | [§18](#18-future-work) |

### 6.4 Element — a list item (one spec per element type)

Elements are typed sub-entities held inside a section's `list` field (`IField` of `kind: "list"`,
each element an `IItem`). An element type is declared in a page type's `elements` map
([§9.3 there](../docs/structured-content.md)):

- **Identity** — an id (injected `newId()`), unique within the owning page.
- **Typed fields** — fields-by-field-kind, exactly like a section's fields.
- **Status FSM** (optional) — e.g. Question `open → resolved`; the missing transition out of
  `resolved` is what makes "can't answer twice" *unrepresentable*. **This is the only place a
  sub-entity carries lifecycle** — sections never do (structured-content §2).
- **Mutated by section operations** — `addElement` / `removeElement` / `moveElement` /
  `setElementField`, plus `transition` for the element FSM, all targeting `(section, field, itemId)`.
  A page command (e.g. `answerQuestion`) maps declaratively to those operations + the element
  transition.

**Registered element types (v1):**

| Element type | Status FSM | Owning page types | Commands |
|---|---|---|---|
| `question` | `open → resolved` | feature-brief, implementation-plan | `askQuestion`, `answerQuestion` |
| `component` | _(none)_ | feature-brief | `addComponent`, `removeComponent` |
| `constraint` | _(none)_ | feature-brief | `addConstraint`, `removeConstraint` |
| `commit` | _(none)_ | feature-brief | `recordCommit` |
| `step` | _(none; ordered)_ | implementation-plan | `addStep`, `removeStep`, `reorderSteps` |
| `task` | `todo ⇄ done` | implementation-checklist | `addTask`, `checkTask`, `uncheckTask`, `removeTask` |
| `case` | `planned → passed`/`failed` | testing-plan | `addCase`, `markCasePassed`, `markCaseFailed` |

### 6.5 Composition & identity

```
Workspace  (aggregate · 1 stream)                         WorkspaceId
├─ children: Map<parent → ordered PageId[]>   ← the page tree
├─ links:    { from, to, role }[]             ← graph edges beyond the tree
└─ pages: Map<PageId, IPageNode>
   └─ Page  (entity · per page type)                      PageId   "feature-brief:01J…"
      └─ sections: ISection[]   (the content tree; may nest)
         ├─ fields: Record<fieldKey, IField>  ← scalar/prose/code/attachment-ref/ref/blocks/list
         │     └─ list → IItem[]
         │          └─ Element (entity · per element type)  itemId scoped to page  "q:01J…"
         └─ meta?  (typed, model-defined — §9.5 there)
```

Containment is strict: a list element belongs to exactly one section, a section to exactly one page,
a page to exactly one workspace. The **page tree** gives each page one parent; the **section tree**
gives each section one (intra-page) parent; **links** add non-hierarchical page edges; a **`ref`**
field/inline-run adds an intra-content typed cross-reference (structured-content §3). All of it folds
from the single workspace stream through the one engine reducer.

### 6.6 Sizing & the escape hatch

A workspace ≈ a *project*, not "all docs ever." Target scale: tens–hundreds of pages and a
**handful (~5) of gentle concurrent writers, mostly on different pages**. [Snapshots](#83-snapshots)
keep rehydration bounded as the stream grows. If a workspace ever becomes genuinely write-hot,
the escape hatch is to route its writes to one epoch-fenced owner, split it, or adopt the
StreamFS hybrid (per-page content streams) — none needed at the target scale.

---

## 7. The guarded-mutation model (FSM)

### 7.1 What has an FSM, and what has invariants

**FSMs live in the model; the engine owns only the FSM *mechanism*** — the guard and its transition
table (§7.2). A page type declares a page status FSM and per-element FSMs; the engine never
hard-codes a lifecycle. **Sections have no FSM** (structured-content §2): they are addressable,
contract-bearing structure, not lifecycle entities.

| Concern | Mechanism | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace lifecycle | workspace-status FSM | `active → archived` (then most mutations are blocked) |
| Page lifecycle | model-declared page status FSM | feature-brief: `draft → planning → building → review → shipped` |
| **Element** (list-item) lifecycle | model-declared element FSM | Question: `open → resolved` (no transition answers it twice) |
| **Sections** | *(no FSM)* — write-gates + contracts instead | mutability via `mutableIn`; existence/shape via structural contracts (structured-content §6) |
| Tree / links / sections | **invariants in handlers** | acyclic page & section trees, parent-exists, unique sibling title, link/`ref`-target-exists, section-set contract |

Status mutations are gated by the relevant **entity's** FSM (the guard reads the target page's or
**list element's** current status out of `IWorkspaceState`). Content mutations are additionally gated
by the target section's **write-gate** (`mutableIn`). Structural mutations are gated by invariants
(+ "is the workspace active?" and "is the target page non-archived?").

### 7.2 Our own guard (a tiny transition table)

**No FSM dependency.** The guard is a pure function over a transition array (~20 lines);
`t()` keeps transitions declarative. We add an optional per-transition `meta` (e.g. a
description) that the LLM tool catalog can surface — something the upstream library doesn't
model. `typescript-fsm` ([§3.1](#31-typescript-fsm-design-reference--not-a-dependency)) is the
shape we copied, nothing we import.

```ts
// core/guard.ts — in-house; typescript-fsm-inspired, zero dependency.
export interface ITransition<S extends string, C extends string> {
  fromState: S; event: C; toState: S;
  meta?: { description?: string };   // optional; surfaced in describeMutations()
}
export const t = <S extends string, C extends string>(
  fromState: S, event: C, toState: S, meta?: ITransition<S, C>["meta"],
): ITransition<S, C> => ({ fromState, event, toState, meta });

export function makeGuard<S extends string, C extends string>(transitions: ITransition<S, C>[]) {
  return {
    /** Is `command` permitted from `status`? */
    can:  (status: S, command: C) => transitions.some((x) => x.fromState === status && x.event === command),
    /** Resulting status, or undefined if not permitted. */
    next: (status: S, command: C) => transitions.find((x) => x.fromState === status && x.event === command)?.toState,
    /** All commands legal from `status` — powers availableMutations(). */
    available: (status: S): C[] =>
      [...new Set(transitions.filter((x) => x.fromState === status).map((x) => x.event))],
    /** Mermaid lifecycle diagram for docs (~15 lines, owned). */
    toMermaid: (title?: string) => renderMermaid(transitions, title),
  };
}
```

### 7.3 Declaring a page type

A page type is one **declarative** object — `IPageTypeDef` (formal interface in
[§10.5](#105-authoring-api-defining-page-and-element-types)) — bundling its `statusTransitions` (the
page FSM, built with `t()` from [§7.2](#72-our-own-guard-a-tiny-transition-table)); its `sections`
(fields-by-field-kind), `elements` (list-item types + their FSMs), `commands`, structural contracts,
and `render` config. It declares **no** `apply` reducer and **no** `render` function — both are
engine-owned (structured-content §9). Authors never write permission `if`s — legality is the
transition table plus the declarative write-gates and contracts.

At command time the bus: (1) validates `args` against the command's `ISchema`; (2) reads the target
entity's current status (page or list element) from the workspace projection; (3) asks the FSM
`can(status, command)`, checks the section write-gate (`mutableIn`) and any transition
`preconditions`; (4) maps the command **declaratively** to **section operations** — or runs its
`produces` escape hatch to compute them (structured-content §9.4) — plus the typed result. The **one
engine reducer** then folds each section operation into the page named by `event.pageId` (recording
the originating command in metadata); structural events update `children` / `links` / `pages`
directly.

---

## 8. Event sourcing & CQRS

### 8.1 The event envelope

```ts
export interface IEventEnvelope<T extends string = string, P = unknown> {
  eventId: string;        // unique id (injected id generator)
  streamId: WorkspaceId;  // the aggregate == the workspace
  pageId?: PageId;        // the page this event targets (absent for pure workspace events)
  version: number;        // 0-based per-WORKSPACE sequence; defines fold order
  type: T;                // a generic operation tag — "SectionOp" | "PageReparented" | "PageCreated" | ...
  schemaVersion: number;  // schema version this payload was written under (§8.5)
  payload: P;             // for a content event: a section operation (§8.1.1)
  meta: IEventMeta;
}

export interface IEventMeta {
  occurredAt: string;     // ISO-8601, from injected Clock (never Date.now() at render)
  actor?: string;         // "llm:planner", "user:ben"
  command?: string;       // the ORIGINATING command name (e.g. "answerQuestion") — keeps history semantic (§8.1.1)
  commandId?: string;     // idempotency: the command instance that produced this event
  causationId?: string; correlationId?: string;
}
```

`version` is **per-workspace** and equals stream length; it drives fold order and optimistic
concurrency. The Durable Streams opaque offset is used only for resuming reads/subscriptions.

### 8.1.1 The section-operation event model

Content events are **generic** — they carry one **section operation** from a **closed,
engine-owned** vocabulary, not a per-type domain event. There are **no** `QuestionAnswered` /
`ConstraintAdded` event types; the same `answerQuestion` command instead appends a `setElementField`
(+ a `transition`) operation, and its name is recorded in `meta.command` so `history()` stays
semantic without coupling history to per-type events ([structured-content §9.4](../docs/structured-content.md)).

The closed operation vocabulary (full table in [§10.5](#105-authoring-api-defining-page-and-element-types) / structured-content §9.4):

| Group | Operations |
|---|---|
| field edit | `setField`, `applyTextEdits` (structured `code` edit by content-hash precondition) |
| list/element edit | `addElement`, `removeElement`, `moveElement`, `setElementField` |
| section-tree edit | `addSection`, `removeSection`, `moveSection`, `renameSection` |
| blocks (document) edit | `addBlock`, `removeBlock`, `moveBlock`, `setBlock` |
| meta | `setMeta` |
| lifecycle | `transition(level, target?, event)` — drive a page/element FSM |

Properties this buys: one upcasting target per operation kind (not per page type); a single
audit/replay path; and a reducer the engine — not the model — owns. **Structural (workspace) events**
(`PageCreated`, `PageReparented`, `LinkAdded`, …) keep their own named types; the
generic-operation model is for **intra-page content**.

### 8.2 Rehydration and the reducer

```ts
function foldWorkspace(
  events: IEventEnvelope[],
  registry: Registry,                                       // resolves field-kinds, element FSMs, contracts, reduceMeta (§10.5)
  from?: { state: IWorkspaceState; fromVersion: number },   // resume from a snapshot (§8.3)
): IWorkspaceState {
  let s = from?.state ?? emptyWorkspace(events[0]);   // events[0] = WorkspaceCreated when from is undefined
  for (const e of events) s = applyWorkspace(s, e, registry);   // routes by e.type / e.pageId
  return s;
}
```

`applyWorkspace` handles structural events itself (mutating `pages`/`children`/`links`) and folds
content events through the **one engine-owned section-operation reducer** into the target page's
section tree — there is **no per-type `apply`**. The reducer is **total and pure** (no I/O, clock, or
randomness) and asserts `version` contiguity (fail fast on a gap). The `registry` supplies the model
data the reducer is parameterized by — declared field-kinds, element FSMs, and the one author
fold-seam, a bounded **meta-scoped `reduceMeta`** (structured-content §9.5) — never a content
reducer. Before the reducer sees an event, it **upcasts** the operation payload to the current schema
([§8.5](#85-schema-evolution-upcasting)).

### 8.3 Snapshots

Because the workspace stream accumulates **all** page + structure activity, snapshots keep
rehydration bounded. A snapshot records `{ version, cursor, state }` — the fold result, the
workspace `version` it covers, and the coarse Durable Streams resume **cursor** (the stream's
next-offset at that point). On load: read the latest snapshot, `read(from = snapshot.cursor)`, and
fold the tail, **skipping any event with `version ≤ snapshot.version`** — the cursor is coarse, so
the fold stays idempotent.

**Cadence:** write a snapshot **every `snapshotEvery` events (default 100) or after
`snapshotIdleMs` of write-idle (default 5000 ms) — whichever comes first**
([§10.1](#101-entry-point--configuration)). The event count bounds rehydration under load; the
idle timer ensures a quiescent workspace still gets a fresh snapshot so reopening is fast.

**Storage:** a **sibling append-only stream** `…/workspace/{id}/snapshot`; readers take the latest
message. With infinite retention ([§9.1](#91-one-stream-per-workspace)) superseded snapshots
linger harmlessly (small; optional compaction later). A snapshot is a cache, never the source of
truth — and a schema bump ([§8.5](#85-schema-evolution-upcasting)) invalidates older snapshots, so
they're dropped and re-folded.

### 8.4 Live projection

The engine is **strict CQRS** (§8.6): a write-side **decide-aggregate** validates and appends, and a
**separate read model** serves reads. The decide-aggregate is the state the command bus folds to run the
FSM guard / invariants / OCC on the hot path (§5, §15); it is *not* what reads see.

`createWiki` ships a **default in-memory read model** — an `IReadModel` (§8.6) maintained per open
workspace, updated two ways: **write-through** after a local append, and a **live tail** (`subscribe`)
that folds in events from other writers. It tracks the highest `version` it has applied as its
**applied token** (§8.6), so `appliedToken()` / `waitFor()` are answered locally. The common path needs
no re-read, and a reader's view stays fresh — this is the same tail that powers G6.

The split is real even in-process: the decide-aggregate is advanced synchronously by the append, while
the read model catches up off the tail, so a read is **eventually consistent** unless gated by a token
(§8.6). An external read model (e.g. a SQL projection) plugs into the same `IReadModel` seam and is fed
by the same tail.

### 8.5 Schema evolution (upcasting)

The log is immutable, so as a schema changes we **upcast on read** rather than rewrite history.
A page type carries a current `version`; every event is stamped with the `schemaVersion` it was
written under ([§8.1](#81-the-event-envelope)). A type supplies **upcasters** keyed by from-version —
each a pure `(payload) => payload` migrating one step. Because content payloads are now **section
operations** over closed field-kinds, an upcaster reshapes an *operation payload* (e.g. a `setField`
value, or a section/element field schema) — a pure payload reshape, exactly as
[structured-content §10](../docs/structured-content.md) requires; field-kinds and section schemas
version through this same mechanism. During fold, before the engine reducer runs, it composes
upcasters from `event.schemaVersion` up to the type's current `version`, so the reducer (and the
render read model) only ever see the current shape:

```ts
// in a page type def (§10.5):
version: 3,
upcasters: {
  1: (p) => ({ ...p, priority: "medium" }),                          // v1 → v2: new field w/ default
  2: ({ owner, ...p }) => ({ ...p, owners: owner ? [owner] : [] }),  // v2 → v3: reshaped
},
```

Upcasters are **pure and total**, do no I/O, and never mutate the stored event (they transform a
copy on the way into the fold). New events are written at the current `version`; structural
(workspace) events version independently of page types. A payload whose `schemaVersion` exceeds
the registered `version` (a forward/unknown version) is a hard error (`UnknownPageTypeError`) —
see below.

> **Unknown page types on rehydrate.** Because state is folded from history, opening a workspace
> whose stream contains a page `type` (or a section operation referencing a field-kind/element type)
> the configured `pageTypes` don't cover has no model data to fold against. Policy: **fail closed** —
> `openWorkspace` throws `UnknownPageTypeError` naming the missing type(s) rather than silently
> dropping events. Register the type (or a compatibility shim) to proceed. This keeps folds total and
> history honest. (The section operation *vocabulary* itself is engine-owned and closed, so no
> operation tag is ever "unknown" — only a model's field-kind usage or element type can be.)

### 8.6 Consistency tokens, read models & CQRS

The engine is **strict CQRS with eventual consistency** ([ADR-003](../docs/wiki/decision-records/cqrs-with-consistency-tokens.md)): the write side (commands → events) and the read side (queryable projections) are **separate**, and the read side trails the write side. Every write returns a **consistency token**; reads may pass a token to **wait** until the read side has caught up. This is what lets a caller convert "eventually consistent" into "consistent with my last write" on demand.

**The consistency token.** A `ConsistencyToken` is an **opaque, comparable string** encoding `{ workspaceId, version }` — `version` being the per-workspace 0-based sequence (== stream length; drives fold order & OCC, §8.1). Tokens are compared **within a single workspace only**; cross-workspace tokens are independent.

```ts
/** Opaque; encodes { workspaceId, version }. Compare WITHIN a workspace only. */
export type ConsistencyToken = string;
```

**Every write returns `Committed<T>`.** A successful command returns its value *and* the token marking where its events landed — the **committed head `version` after the append and any OCC rebase-retry** (§15), not a pre-rebase guess. An idempotent or zero-event write (a deduplicated `commandId`) returns the **current** head. Writes **do not** block on the read model.

```ts
export interface Committed<T> {
  readonly value: T;
  readonly token: ConsistencyToken;
}
```

This wraps **every** write, including the eight currently-`Promise<void>` structural commands — `reparent`, `reorder`, `setPageTitle`, `archivePage`, `link`, `unlink`, `moveItem`, and `archive()` (§10.3) — which become `Promise<Committed<void>>`: they mutate graph state a caller reads back, so they carry a token too. (A breaking API change — see [ADR-003](../docs/wiki/decision-records/cqrs-with-consistency-tokens.md).)

**The read-model interface.** Any projection — the default in-memory one (§8.4) or an external one — implements `IReadModel`:

```ts
export interface IReadModel {
  /** How far this read model has applied, for a workspace (the zero token if unknown). */
  appliedToken(workspace: WorkspaceId): Promise<ConsistencyToken>;
  /** Resolve once applied ≥ token; reject with ConsistencyTimeoutError after timeoutMs. */
  waitFor(token: ConsistencyToken, opts?: { timeoutMs?: number }): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Token-aware, async reads.** Because a read may have to wait for the read side to catch up, the handle's reads (`tree`/`page`/`toMarkdown`/`status`/`history`, §10.3) take an **optional** token and return a `Promise`:

```ts
read(query, { consistentWith?: ConsistencyToken; timeoutMs?: number }): Promise<…>
//   token present → waitFor(token) then serve  (read-your-writes / monotonic)
//   token absent  → serve current state         (eventually consistent; may be stale)
```

With a token present, the read calls `waitFor(token)` then serves — giving **read-your-writes** by threading the token from a prior `Committed<T>`. With no token it serves the current projection — fast, but possibly stale. A `waitFor` that exceeds `timeoutMs` rejects with **`ConsistencyTimeoutError`** (a `WikiError` subclass, §14); the default timeout is `IWikiConfig.readConsistencyTimeoutMs` (default 5000, §10.1).

**The write-side / read-side split.** The command bus folds a **write-side decide-aggregate** purely to validate the FSM, invariants, and OCC and to append (§5, §15). A **separate read model** — fed by the live tail, token-gated — serves reads (§8.4). The default in-memory read model makes the engine CQRS-correct standalone, with no database; external read models implement the same `IReadModel` against this seam.

**A public, pure fold is exported.** External read models apply each commit by folding it with the engine's own reducer (so they can never *semantically* diverge — same upcasting, same unknown-type policy), then serializing the resulting `IWorkspaceState`. `foldWorkspace(events, registry, from?)` and `applyWorkspace(state, event, registry)` are **exported** from the `wiki` barrel for that purpose ([ADR-003](../docs/wiki/decision-records/cqrs-with-consistency-tokens.md), [§16.1](#161-what-each-file-owns)). Because the fold routes content events through the page-type reducers, the **`Registry`** is exported via the **`wiki/registry`** subpath ([§10.7](#107-package-entry-points)) so a consumer can build one from its `pageTypes`; and the opaque token codec (`encodeToken`/`decodeToken`/`ZERO_VERSION`) is exported too, so an external read model can compare/produce the same `ConsistencyToken` the engine's writes return.

## 9. Persistence with Durable Streams

The wiki uses Durable Streams **directly**, through one thin `EventLog` module — no storage
abstraction ([ADR-001](../docs/wiki/decision-records/use-durable-streams-directly-no-storage-port.md)).
Storage *durability* (in-memory / file / ACID) is chosen on the DS **server** you point at, not
in the wiki ([§3.2](#32-durable-streams-the-persistence-substrate)).

### 9.1 One stream per workspace

| Wiki concept | Durable Streams |
|---|---|
| workspace (aggregate) | one stream URL: `{baseUrl}/{namespace}/workspace/{workspaceId}` |
| ensure exists | `DurableStream.create({ url, contentType: "application/json", ttlSeconds })` (idempotent) |
| append a command's events | `IdempotentProducer(handle, workspaceId, …)` → `append()` each → `flush()` (**one atomic POST of the array**) |
| one event | one JSON message |
| read from a position | `stream({ url, offset, live: false })` then `.json()` |
| live tail (G6) | `stream({ url, offset, live: true })` → `subscribeJson(batch => …)` |
| our `version` (0..N) | carried in payload; **not** the opaque DS offset |
| optimistic concurrency | `expectedVersion` → conditional append (`PreconditionFailedError`) |
| exactly-once / fencing | `Producer-Id` = `workspaceId`, `Producer-Seq` = `version`, `Producer-Epoch` fences a stale writer |
| retention | **infinite** — no TTL on workspace streams; full history is the source of truth (snapshots are an optimization, not a trim) |

```ts
// illustrative — the ONLY module that imports @durable-streams/client
import { DurableStream, IdempotentProducer, stream } from "@durable-streams/client";

export class EventLog {
  constructor(private cfg: { baseUrl: string; namespace: string; ttlSeconds?: number }) {}
  private urlFor(ws: WorkspaceId) { return `${this.cfg.baseUrl}/${this.cfg.namespace}/workspace/${encodeURIComponent(ws)}`; }

  /** Append a command's events as ONE atomic batch, asserting the head is at expectedVersion. */
  async append(ws: WorkspaceId, events: IEventEnvelope[], opts: { expectedVersion: number }) {
    const handle = await DurableStream.create({ url: this.urlFor(ws), contentType: "application/json", ttlSeconds: this.cfg.ttlSeconds });
    const producer = new IdempotentProducer(handle, ws, { autoClaim: true, onError: (e) => { throw e; } });
    for (const e of events) producer.append(e);    // e.version is its seq; precondition = expectedVersion
    await producer.flush();                         // throws PreconditionFailedError on a stale append
    return { headVersion: events.at(-1)!.version /*, lastOffset from flush */ };
  }

  /** Read from a coarse cursor; order & dedup are by `event.version`, never the offset. */
  async read(ws: WorkspaceId, fromCursor?: string): Promise<{ events: IEventEnvelope[]; nextCursor: string }> {
    const res = await stream<IEventEnvelope>({ url: this.urlFor(ws), offset: fromCursor, live: false });
    return { events: await res.json(), nextCursor: res.nextOffset };   // batch-level resume cursor
  }

  /** Live tail: hand the consumer each batch's events + the cursor to persist for resume. */
  async subscribe(ws: WorkspaceId, onBatch: (events: IEventEnvelope[], cursor: string) => unknown, opts?: { fromCursor?: string }) {
    const res = await stream<IEventEnvelope>({ url: this.urlFor(ws), offset: opts?.fromCursor, live: true });
    return res.subscribeJson(async (batch) => { await onBatch(batch.items, batch.offset); });
  }
}
```

> **Offsets.** We never rely on per-message offsets: per-event order and dedup come from our
> monotonic `version`; the Durable Streams offset is only a coarse resume **cursor** (the
> response's next-offset / each batch's offset). On resume we read from the saved cursor and skip
> any event with `version ≤` the last folded version. Snapshots ([§8.3](#83-snapshots)) persist
> that cursor with the state in a sibling `…/workspace/{id}/snapshot` stream, via the same `EventLog`.

### 9.2 Why no port / interface?

One backend (Durable Streams); its durability is already a server setting; the in-memory
`DurableStreamTestServer` is a faithful, fast test store (no hand-rolled fake to drift). Promote
`EventLog` to an interface only if a real second backend appears. See ADR-001.

### 9.3 The namespace catalog

A namespace owns one extra stream — the **catalog** at `…/{namespace}/_catalog` — recording
workspace lifecycle (`WorkspaceRegistered { id, name }`, `WorkspaceRenamed`, `WorkspaceArchived`).
`wiki.listWorkspaces()` folds it; `createWorkspace` / `archive` append to it. It is a **secondary
index, not a consistency boundary**: creating a workspace writes the workspace stream first, then
appends a catalog entry (a second stream → not atomic with the first), so the catalog is
eventually consistent and fully **rebuildable** by enumerating the `…/{namespace}/workspace/`
streams. The catalog is also where **namespace-level configuration** will live (defaults, access
policy, the registered page-type set) — *reserved, not yet designed*.

---

## 10. Public TypeScript API

This section is the package's **external contract**, expressed as documented `interface`s.
**Implementations are internal and never exported:** `createWiki` wires up the command bus, the
`EventLog` ([§9](#9-persistence-with-durable-streams)), reducers, and renderers behind these
interfaces. Consumers program against the interfaces only — if a symbol isn't listed in
[§10.7](#107-package-entry-points) it isn't public.

> Code layout reflects the split: the **interfaces** live in `src/api.ts` (no implementation);
> the classes that satisfy them live in `core/` and `stores/`; `index.ts` re-exports the public
> surface ([§16](#16-structure-folders-files-and-module-boundaries)). For a runnable walkthrough see
> [§13](#13-worked-example-an-llm-plans-and-ships-a-feature); this section is the reference.

### 10.1 Entry point & configuration

```ts
/** Create a wiki bound to a Durable Streams server and a fixed set of page types. */
export function createWiki(config: IWikiConfig): IWiki;

/** Immutable configuration for a {@link IWiki}. */
export interface IWikiConfig {
  /** Where workspaces are stored; one Durable Stream is created per workspace. */
  readonly stream: IStreamConfig;
  /** The page types this wiki understands. An unknown `type` is rejected at `createPage`. */
  readonly pageTypes: readonly IPageType[];
  /** Returns the current time as ISO-8601. Injected for determinism/testing. @default () => new Date().toISOString() */
  readonly clock?: () => string;
  /** Generates unique ids (workspace/page/item/event). Injected for determinism/testing. @default a ULID factory */
  readonly ids?: () => string;
  /** Default `actor` stamped on event metadata when a call doesn't override it. */
  readonly actor?: string;
  /** Snapshot after this many events per workspace, or 0 to disable count-based snapshots. @default 100 @see §8.3 */
  readonly snapshotEvery?: number;
  /** Time-based backup: snapshot after this many ms of write-idle. @default 5000 @see §8.3 */
  readonly snapshotIdleMs?: number;
  /** Default timeout (ms) for a token-gated read's `waitFor` before it throws
   *  {@link ConsistencyTimeoutError}; a per-read `timeoutMs` overrides it. @default 5000 @see §8.6 */
  readonly readConsistencyTimeoutMs?: number;
  /** Bound the in-memory projection cache of open workspaces, or `false` to disable caching. */
  readonly cache?: { readonly maxWorkspaces?: number } | false;
  /** Optional sink invoked for every appended event (logging/metrics). Must not throw. */
  readonly onEvent?: (event: IEventEnvelope) => void;
}

/** Connection to a Durable Streams server. Storage *durability* is a server setting (§3.2). */
export interface IStreamConfig {
  /** Base URL of the server, e.g. "http://127.0.0.1:4437". */
  readonly baseUrl: string;
  /** Namespace/tenant segment: streams live at `{baseUrl}/{namespace}/workspace/{id}`. */
  readonly namespace: string;
  /** Optional stream TTL (seconds). **Omit for infinite retention** (the default) — event sourcing
   *  needs full history; snapshots are an optimization, not a trimming mechanism (§9.1). */
  readonly ttlSeconds?: number;
}
```

### 10.2 The `IWiki` interface (what `createWiki` returns)

```ts
/**
 * Top-level handle. Holds no workspace state itself; it creates/opens {@link IWorkspaceHandle}s,
 * each of which is exactly one event-sourced aggregate (one Durable Stream).
 */
export interface IWiki {
  /**
   * Create a new, empty workspace and return a live handle. Appends `WorkspaceCreated`.
   * @param input.name human-readable name.
   * @param input.id   optional explicit id (else generated) — handy for deterministic tests.
   */
  createWorkspace(input: { name: string; id?: WorkspaceId }): Promise<IWorkspaceHandle>;

  /**
   * Open an existing workspace, rehydrating its state (latest snapshot + folded tail).
   * @throws {@link WorkspaceNotFoundError} if no stream exists for `id`.
   * @throws {@link UnknownPageTypeError} if the history contains an unregistered page/event type (§8.5).
   */

}

export interface IWorkspaceSummary {

  readonly name: string;
  readonly status: "active" | "archived";
}
```

### 10.3 The `IWorkspaceHandle` interface (one workspace = the aggregate)

```ts
/**
 * A live handle to one workspace aggregate. Structural commands mutate the page graph; `mutate`
 * applies a page-scoped, FSM-gated command. Every command appends atomically to the single
 * workspace stream (§6, §15) and resolves to a {@link Committed} value carrying the workspace's
 * **committed head {@link ConsistencyToken}** — the position after the append *and* any OCC
 * rebase-retry (§8.6). Reads are served by the workspace's read model (default in-memory, §8.4),
 * eventually consistent: pass `consistentWith` a write's token to read-your-writes (the read
 * `waitFor`s the read model before serving), or omit it to serve current (possibly stale) state.
 */

### 10.5 Authoring API: defining page and element types

The interfaces a consumer implements to extend the wiki. Authoring is **declarative**: a page type
declares **sections + field-kinds**, **element (list-item) types + their FSMs**, **commands**,
**structural contracts**, and **render config** — and declares **no** reducer and **no** renderer
(both are engine-owned). The shapes below are the engine-facing summary; the full declarative
grammar (section/field declarations, the args→field mapping, render config) lives in
[structured-content §9](../docs/structured-content.md). Referenced by
[§6.3](#63-page--an-entity-one-spec-per-page-type)/[§6.4](#64-element--a-list-item-one-spec-per-element-type)/[§7.3](#73-declaring-a-page-type):

`IRenderConfig` (the declarative, logic-free render config — section order, per-field-kind display
directives, grouping, element templates) is detailed in [§11](#11-deterministic-markdown-rendering)
and [structured-content §9.7](../docs/structured-content.md). The `Registry` validates every
declaration **mechanically** at load (keys resolve, field-kinds are known, predicates callable) and
hot-reloads via the `ModelRegistry`.

> **`defineItemType` is retired.** A sub-entity is now a **list-element type** declared inline in the
> page type's `elements` map (`IElementTypeDef`) — there is no longer a free-standing item registered
> across pages. The standing names: a section's `list` field holds **elements**, each of one declared
> element type, which may carry a status FSM (§6.4).

### 10.6 Exported data types and errors

- **Event/state types:** `IEventEnvelope`, `IEventMeta` ([§8.1](#81-the-event-envelope));
  `IWorkspaceState`, `IPageNode`, `ISection`, `IField`, `IBlock`, `IInline`, `IItem`, `RefTarget`
  ([§6.2](#62-workspace--the-aggregate-stream-root), structured-content §2–§3);
  `ITreeNode`, `IMutationDescriptor`, `IWorkspaceSummary` (above). The content-event payload is a
  generic **`ISectionOp`** ([§8.1.1](#811-the-section-operation-event-model)); `DomainEvent` is the
  base event union (`{ type: string; pageId?: PageId; payload: unknown }`), with content events
  carrying an `ISectionOp` payload.
- **CQRS consistency types** ([§8.6](#86-consistency-tokens-read-models--cqrs)):
  `ConsistencyToken` (opaque, comparable `string` encoding `{ workspaceId, version }`; compared
  *within* a workspace only); `Committed<T>` = `{ readonly value: T; readonly token: ConsistencyToken }`,
  the return shape of **every** write; `IReadOpts` (the optional `{ consistentWith?, timeoutMs? }`
  reads take, above); and `IReadModel` (`appliedToken(workspace)` / `waitFor(token, opts?)`), the
  read-side seam an external read model implements.
- **Branded ids:** `WorkspaceId`, `PageId` (opaque `string` brands).
- **Errors:** every error class is exported and documented in [§14](#14-errors--validation) — all
  extend `WikiError`, so a consumer can catch the base or narrow on `code`/`instanceof`. This now
  includes `ConsistencyTimeoutError` (thrown when a token-gated read's `waitFor` exceeds its
  timeout — added in [§14](#14-errors--validation)).

### 10.7 Package entry points

| Import | Public exports |
|---|---|
| `wiki` | `createWiki`; interfaces `IWiki`, `IWorkspaceHandle`, `IPageView`, `IWikiConfig`, `IStreamConfig`; authoring `definePageType`, `t`, `arg`, and the `*Def` / `ISchema` / `ISectionOp` / context interfaces; the data types (incl. `ISection`/`IField`/`IBlock`/`IItem`); all error classes; the **CQRS** surface — `Committed`, `ConsistencyToken`, `IReadOpts`, `IReadModel`, the public `foldWorkspace`/`applyWorkspace`, and the token codec `encodeToken`/`decodeToken`/`ZERO_VERSION` (§8.6). |
| `wiki/registry` | the `Registry` class (build one from a `pageTypes` set) — for an **external read model** that reuses the public `foldWorkspace` (§8.6). |
| `wiki/authoring` | the public **declarative authoring API** external schema packages import — `definePageType`, `t`, `arg`; the Zod schema adapter (`zodSchema`/`z`); `InvariantViolationError`/`WikiError`; and the `api` type vocabulary (`export type * from "./api"`, incl. `ISectionDef`/`IFieldDef`/`IElementTypeDef`/`ICommandDef`/`ISectionOp`/`IRenderConfig`). Bundles author against THIS surface, never the engine's internal module paths. (The barrel `wiki` "." still re-exports the authoring fns too.) The worked-example page types now ship from a sibling package — `wiki-models/feature` (each `IPageType`; the bundle's **default export** is the page-type array). The retired render helpers and `defineItemType` are gone — render is config (§11) and sub-entities are inline `elements`. |
| `wiki/render` | the configurable **Markdown render read model** the engine ships (§11) — a sibling of the SQL read model; consumed by hosts to render folded state from a model's static render config. |
| `wiki/testing` *(dev only)* | helpers to start an in-memory `DurableStreamTestServer` and an `IWiki` bound to it. |

## 11. Deterministic Markdown rendering

**Render is a READ MODEL, not a per-type function** ([ADR-007](../docs/wiki/decision-records/render-as-a-configurable-read-model.md), [structured-content §8](../docs/structured-content.md)).
The engine ships a configurable **Markdown render read model** — a sibling of the SQL read model and
the AST/symbol projections (§8.4) — that **walks a page's section tree and dispatches on field-kind**.
Each field-kind ships a default deterministic render; a page type supplies declarative **render
config** (section order, headings/labels, per-kind display, groupings such as open/resolved) instead
of a hand-coded `render(page, ctx)`. **The per-type `render` function is retired** — a page type now
declares `render: IRenderConfig`, never a renderer; the engine owns the walk.

A page's Markdown remains a **pure function of its folded state plus the model's *static* render
config**; equal state → byte-identical output. Determinism is therefore a property of this read
model.

**Determinism rules (enforced by tests):**

1. **No wall-clock or randomness at render time** — timestamps come from `meta.occurredAt` already
   in state. **Any value that needs computing is materialized into a field by a command, never
   computed at render time** (render config is logic-free, structured-content §9.7).
2. **Stable ordering** — render collections by explicit `order`/array order, never object-key
   enumeration (sections by `order`, blocks/inline runs by array order). The page tree renders in
   `children` order.
3. **Canonical formatting** — fixed heading levels, `\n` line endings, single trailing newline, no
   trailing whitespace, ISO-8601 dates. **Render is identity, never a formatter:** a `code` field/block
   fences verbatim; `blocks` render in a fixed normal form (merged adjacent same-mark text,
   canonical-sorted marks, rectangular escaped GFM tables) — no Markdown formatter ever runs
   (structured-content §10).
4. **Total over state** — empty/optional fields render explicit placeholders (e.g. `_No summary._`)
   so diffs stay local; a `ref`'s displayed text is the **render-derived label** of its target
   (section number, page title, symbol name), so reorders/renames/renumbers update it automatically.
5. **No external lookups** — render from state only (titles/links denormalized in the workspace),
   never by fetching; language machinery (parsers/ASTs) is read-side in the host, never in render
   (structured-content §4).

The render read model walks the section tree, applies per-field-kind display, and groups list
elements (e.g. the feature-brief open/resolved question split) per the model's render config;
whole-workspace render emits the page tree as nested headings or a table of contents. The FSM's
`toMermaid()` can still emit lifecycle diagrams into dev docs.

> **Open** (structured-content §8): the render-config vocabulary must cover today's bespoke layouts
> without becoming "config that is secretly code"; it is to be specified there.

## 12. Designed for LLMs

- **Mutations ⇒ tools.** Each command's Zod schema exports to **JSON Schema**
  (`describeMutations()`) → drops straight into Anthropic/OpenAI tool definitions, for both
  page-scoped and structural commands.
- **Only legal actions are offered.** `availableMutations()` is derived from the FSM for the
  page's *current* status, so the model is handed only tools it can legally use now; the
  server-side guard still rejects illegal calls.
- **Structured, actionable errors.** `MutationNotAllowedError` reports current status + the legal
  set; structural errors (`CycleError`, `ParentNotFoundError`) say exactly what's wrong, so the
  model self-corrects in one step.
- **One consistent object to reason over.** A workspace loads as a single coherent
  state+history; the agent sees the whole graph atomically, and `subscribe` streams every change
  (G6) — the agent loop Durable Streams was built for.
- **Deterministic context & replayable history** — stable Markdown between turns; the event log
  is a literal transcript for "what changed," undo, and branching.
- **Idempotent commands** — optional `commandId` collapses retried tool calls to one effect.

---

## 13. Worked example: an LLM plans and ships a feature

The running example: an agent drives a feature from brief → plan → implementation → shipped, in
one workspace. It exercises a page type that **mandates child pages**, a tree of typed **sections**
holding four list-element types, references-as-links, and **cross-page invariants** that are only
checkable because the brief and its children share one aggregate (§6, ADR-002). The `feature` bundle
is authored **directly on sections** — greenfield, no `fields`/`items` migration
([ADR-010](../docs/wiki/decision-records/greenfield-no-backward-compatibility.md)).

### 13.1 The page types

A workspace is a *project* holding many top-level **feature briefs**. A `feature-brief`
**requires three child pages**, created atomically with it:

| Page type | Role | Status FSM | List-element types | Required children |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `feature-brief` | brief: components, constraints, open questions, commits | `draft → planning → building → review → shipped` (+ `abandoned`) | `component`, `constraint`, `question`, `commit` | `implementation-plan`, `implementation-checklist`, `testing-plan` |
| `implementation-plan` | ordered plan of attack | `draft → ready` | `step`, `question` | — |
| `implementation-checklist` | tracked work items | `building → complete` | `task` | — |
| `testing-plan` | test cases + results | `draft → ready` | `case` | — |

`createPage("feature-brief", …)` emits, in **one atomic append**, the brief's `PageCreated` plus
a `PageCreated` for each mandated child — so a brief never exists without its
plan/checklist/testing-plan, and those children can't be reparented out or archived alone
(`InvariantViolationError`). At creation the brief's **required sections** are materialized empty
(structured-content §6). **References** to other features/pages are typed **links**
(`ws.link(brief, other, "depends-on" | "relates-to" | "supersedes")`), rendered as the brief's
"References" section. The brief's content is a tree of typed **sections** (no `fields`/`items`
record); illustratively:

```ts
// feature-brief sections (declared via definePageType.sections; see §10.5 / structured-content §9.2):
sections: {
  summary:     { name: "Summary", required: true, mutableIn: ["draft","planning"],
                 fields: { body: { kind: "prose", required: true } } },
  components:  { name: "Components affected", mutableIn: ["draft","planning","building"],
                 fields: { items: { kind: "list", element: "component" } } },        // affected components (web-app, cli, …)
  constraints: { name: "Design constraints",  mutableIn: ["draft","planning","building"],
                 fields: { items: { kind: "list", element: "constraint", ordered: true } } },
  questions:   { name: "Questions", mutableIn: ["draft","planning","building","review"],
                 fields: { items: { kind: "list", element: "question" } } },         // question: open → resolved
  commits:     { name: "Commits", mutableIn: ["building","review"],
                 fields: { items: { kind: "list", element: "commit" } } },
  // references are links on the workspace graph (not a field) — rendered from linksOf in render config
}
```

### 13.2 The FSMs that matter

The brief lifecycle — the agent iterates planning ⇄ building:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> draft
  draft --> draft: setSummary / addComponent / addConstraint / askQuestion / answerQuestion
  draft --> planning: beginPlanning
  planning --> planning: addConstraint / askQuestion / answerQuestion
  planning --> building: beginImplementation
  building --> building: addConstraint / askQuestion / answerQuestion / recordCommit
  building --> planning: reopenPlanning
  building --> review: submitForReview
  review --> building: requestChanges
  review --> shipped: ship
  draft --> abandoned: abandon
  planning --> abandoned: abandon
  building --> abandoned: abandon
  review --> abandoned: abandon
  shipped --> [*]
  abandoned --> [*]
```

The list-element FSMs — a question can't be answered twice; a checklist task toggles; a test case
records a run (`component`, `constraint`, and `commit` are plain elements, no lifecycle):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  state question {
    [*] --> open
    open --> resolved: answerQuestion
  }
  state task {
    [*] --> todo
    todo --> done: checkTask
    done --> todo: uncheckTask
  }
  state "test case" as testcase {
    [*] --> planned
    planned --> passed: markCasePassed
    planned --> failed: markCaseFailed
    failed  --> passed: markCasePassed
  }
```

### 13.3 A session: plan, build, ship

Every write returns `Committed<T>` — its `value` plus the `token` (the committed head `version`
after the append and any OCC rebase-retry, §8.6); even the void structural commands carry a token,
since they change the graph the agent reads back. Reads are `async` and take an optional
`{ consistentWith?: token }` to convert eventual consistency into read-your-writes (§10.3, §10.4).
Unused tokens are simply ignored here; we keep the last one to read against in §13.5.

```ts
const ws = await wiki.createWorkspace({ name: "Acme platform" });

// One call → brief + its 3 mandated children, atomically (4 PageCreated events in one append).
// createPage returns Committed<PageId>: the new id + a token naming where the events landed.
const { value: brief, token: tCreated } = await ws.createPage("feature-brief", { title: "Bulk export", parentId: null });
const page = await ws.page(brief, { consistentWith: tCreated });
const [plan, checklist, testPlan] = (await page.children()).map((c) => c.id);

// ── fill the brief ── (mutate returns Committed<CommandResult>; destructure value when there is one)
await ws.mutate(brief, "setSummary", { text: "Let users export their workspace as CSV/JSON." });
await ws.mutate(brief, "addComponent", { name: "web-app" });
await ws.mutate(brief, "addComponent", { name: "cli" });
await ws.mutate(brief, "addConstraint", { text: "Export must stream; never buffer >50MB in memory." });
const { value: { questionId: q1 } } = await ws.mutate(brief, "askQuestion", { text: "Which formats in v1?" });
await ws.mutate(brief, "answerQuestion", { questionId: q1, answer: "CSV and JSON; Parquet later." });
await ws.link(brief, "feature-brief:01H…rbac" as PageId, "depends-on");   // Committed<void> — reference another feature in this workspace

// ── planning ──
await ws.mutate(brief, "beginPlanning", {});
await ws.mutate(plan, "addStep", { text: "Stream a ReadableStream from a new /export endpoint." });
await ws.mutate(plan, "addStep", { text: "Add `wiki export` CLI wrapping the endpoint." });
const { value: { caseId: c1 } } = await ws.mutate(testPlan, "addCase", { text: "10k-row export < 2s, memory flat." });

// a question that's really a planning detail → move it onto the plan (atomic cross-page move)
const { value: { questionId: q2 } } = await ws.mutate(brief, "askQuestion", { text: "Page size while streaming?" });
// one removeElement (brief.questions) + one addElement (plan.questions), one append (§8.1.1)
await ws.moveItem({ from: brief, to: plan, fromSection: "questions", toSection: "questions", field: "items", itemId: q2 });

// ── implementation ── (beginImplementation is gated: plan ≥1 step AND testing-plan ≥1 case)
await ws.mutate(brief, "beginImplementation", {});
const { value: { taskId: t1 } } = await ws.mutate(checklist, "addTask", { text: "Streaming /export endpoint" });
const { value: { taskId: t2 } } = await ws.mutate(checklist, "addTask", { text: "`wiki export` CLI" });
const { value: { taskId: t3 } } = await ws.mutate(checklist, "addTask", { text: "Docs + changelog" });

await ws.mutate(brief, "recordCommit", { sha: "a1b2c3d", message: "feat(api): streaming export endpoint" });
await ws.mutate(checklist, "checkTask", { taskId: t1 });
await ws.mutate(brief, "recordCommit", { sha: "e4f5g6h", message: "feat(cli): wiki export" });
await ws.mutate(checklist, "checkTask", { taskId: t2 });
await ws.mutate(testPlan, "markCasePassed", { caseId: c1 });

// ── review → ship ── (ship is gated: checklist 100% done, all cases passed, no open questions)
await ws.mutate(brief, "submitForReview", {});
await ws.mutate(checklist, "checkTask", { taskId: t3 });   // finish docs after review feedback
const { token: tShipped } = await ws.mutate(brief, "ship", {});   // keep the head token to read against (§13.5)
```

### 13.4 Cross-page invariants the single aggregate buys us

Because the brief and its children fold from **one stream**, a brief command can read its
children's state and enforce gates **atomically** — no second fetch, no race:

- `beginImplementation` (planning→building) requires the `implementation-plan` to have ≥1 step
  **and** the `testing-plan` ≥1 case.
- `ship` (review→shipped) requires the `implementation-checklist` 100% done, every `testing-plan`
  case `passed`, and **zero open questions** on the brief.

A failing gate throws `InvariantViolationError` naming what's missing — an LLM reads it and acts.
These checks would be racy (or impossible to do atomically) if each page were its own stream.

### 13.5 Sample deterministic render + tree

Reads are `async` now; passing the ship token as `consistentWith` waits for the read model to
catch up so the render reflects every write above (read-your-writes, §10.3) before serving:

```ts
// token-gated read → guaranteed to see the just-shipped state (not an eventually-consistent stale view)
const view = await ws.page(brief, { consistentWith: tShipped });
const kids = await view.children();     // [implementation-plan, implementation-checklist, testing-plan]
const md   = await ws.toMarkdown(brief, { consistentWith: tShipped });
```

The brief, rendered mid-flight (status `building`; q1 resolved, q2 moved to the plan):

```markdown
# Feature: Bulk export

**Status:** building

## Summary
Let users export their workspace as CSV/JSON.

## Components affected
- web-app
- cli

## Design constraints
1. Export must stream; never buffer >50MB in memory.

## Open questions
_None._

## Resolved questions
- **Which formats in v1?** → CSV and JSON; Parquet later.

## References
- depends-on → Access control (RBAC)

## Child pages
- Implementation plan
- Implementation checklist
- Testing plan

## Commits
- `a1b2c3d` feat(api): streaming export endpoint
- `e4f5g6h` feat(cli): wiki export
```

```
@root
└─ Bulk export                 (feature-brief, building)
   ├─ Implementation plan      (implementation-plan, draft)
   ├─ Implementation checklist (implementation-checklist, building)
   └─ Testing plan             (testing-plan, draft)
```

### 13.6 Available mutations by feature-brief status (what the LLM is offered)

| Status | Offered (page-scoped) mutations on the brief |
|---|---|
| `draft` | setSummary, addComponent, removeComponent, addConstraint, removeConstraint, askQuestion, answerQuestion\*, beginPlanning, abandon |
| `planning` | addConstraint, removeConstraint, askQuestion, answerQuestion\*, beginImplementation†, abandon |
| `building` | addConstraint, askQuestion, answerQuestion\*, recordCommit, reopenPlanning, submitForReview, abandon |
| `review` | recordCommit, requestChanges, ship†, abandon |
| `shipped` / `abandoned` | _(none — terminal)_ |

\* effective only for an `open` question. † additionally gated by a cross-page invariant (§13.4).
Structural commands (createPage, reparent, reorder, link, moveItem, archivePage) and each child
page's own commands (`addStep`; `addTask`/`checkTask`; `addCase`/`markCasePassed`; …) are offered
per their own FSMs.

---

## 14. Errors & validation

```ts
class WikiError extends Error { code: string; }
class ValidationError         extends WikiError { issues: SchemaIssue[]; }
class MutationNotAllowedError extends WikiError { pageType: string; status: string; command: string; allowed: string[]; }
class WorkspaceNotFoundError  extends WikiError { id: string; }
class WorkspaceArchivedError  extends WikiError { id: string; }
class PageNotFoundError       extends WikiError { id: string; }
class ItemNotFoundError       extends WikiError { itemType: string; id: string; }
class ParentNotFoundError     extends WikiError { parentId: string; }
class CycleError              extends WikiError { pageId: string; newParentId: string; }   // reparent would cycle
class DuplicateTitleError     extends WikiError { parentId: string | null; title: string; }
class LinkTargetNotFoundError extends WikiError { target: string; }
class ConcurrencyError        extends WikiError { expected: number; actual: number; }      // rebase retries exhausted
class InvariantViolationError extends WikiError { detail: string; }
class UnknownPageTypeError    extends WikiError { types: string[]; }   // rehydrate hit an unregistered page/event type (§8.5)
class ConsistencyTimeoutError extends WikiError { token: ConsistencyToken; timeoutMs: number; } // a token-gated read's waitFor timed out (§8.6)
```

- **Validation** uses each command's runtime schema (**Zod**: `z.infer` for static types,
  `zod-to-json-schema` for the LLM tool export), behind a thin `ISchema<T>` adapter. LLM-supplied
  args are *always* validated.
- Errors carry enough structure for an agent to recover (status + allowed set; the cycle's two
  ids; the missing parent id).
- **`ConsistencyTimeoutError`** is thrown when a token-gated read's `waitFor` exceeds `timeoutMs`
  (the call's override or `IWikiConfig.readConsistencyTimeoutMs`, default 5000) — the read model
  hasn't applied the requested `ConsistencyToken` in time ([§8.6](#86-consistency-tokens-read-models--cqrs)).
  It carries the awaited `token` + `timeoutMs` so a caller can retry or fall back to an
  eventually-consistent read (omit the token).

---

## 15. Concurrency, idempotency & ordering

Target: a workspace has **~5 gentle concurrent writers, mostly on different pages**. That's low
contention, so plain optimistic concurrency suffices — **no single-writer actor/routing system.**

- **In-process:** the command bus **serializes commands per `workspaceId`** (a small async
  queue), so one process never races itself.
- **Cross-process:** every append carries `expectedVersion` (the head we folded from). Durable
  Streams rejects a stale append with `PreconditionFailedError`. On conflict we
  **rebase-and-retry**: `read` the (usually tiny) new tail, fold it forward, re-run the command's
  guard + `decide` against the fresh state, and re-append. Because writers are usually on
  *different* pages, the command is still valid and the retry succeeds immediately. Retries are
  bounded; exhaustion surfaces `ConcurrencyError`.
- **Concurrency never bypasses the FSM.** If two writers race the *same* page (both answer one
  question), the first wins; the loser's rebase re-checks the FSM, sees `resolved`, and correctly
  fails with `MutationNotAllowedError`. The rebase re-validates invariants too (a reparent that
  would now cycle is rejected on retry).
- **One tail, all updates (G6).** Readers `subscribe` to the single workspace stream and fold a
  local projection; reads never contend with writers.
- **Idempotency / fencing:** `Producer-Id = workspaceId`, `Producer-Seq = version` (exactly-once
  on retry); `Producer-Epoch` fences a stale writer if ownership ever moves. Commands carry an
  optional `commandId`; a duplicate already in the stream short-circuits.
- **Ordering:** fold order is the per-workspace `version` == stream order; the reducer asserts
  contiguity and fails fast on a gap.
- **Escape hatch (not needed now):** if a workspace becomes write-hot, route its writes to a
  single epoch-fenced owner (zero conflicts), split it, or adopt the StreamFS hybrid. See
  [ADR-002](../docs/wiki/decision-records/workspace-as-the-aggregate-one-stream.md).

## 16. Structure: folders, files, and module boundaries

A pnpm/npm workspaces monorepo. `wiki/` is this package (transport-free core). Siblings: **`wiki-models/`**
holds runtime-loadable page-type **schema bundles** authored against `wiki/authoring` (the worked-example
types now ship from `wiki-models/feature`); **`wiki-mcp/`** is the long-lived **read-model + MCP host** that
embeds the engine; **`wiki-server/`** is the Durable Streams **host** that also hosts `wiki-mcp`; and
**`wiki-cli/`** is a set-aside future client.

### 16.2 Dependency direction (a DAG pointing at `api.ts`)

The boundaries that keep the architecture honest:

- **`api.ts` depends on nothing**, and everything depends on it — interfaces split from
  implementations (§10). Implementations live under `core/` and `stores/`.
- **`stores/event-log.ts` is the sole importer of `@durable-streams/client`** — upgrading or
  swapping the storage client touches exactly one file ([ADR-001](../docs/wiki/decision-records/use-durable-streams-directly-no-storage-port.md)).
- **Page types are declarative plugins.** External schema bundles import only the *public authoring
  API* — the `wiki/authoring` entry point (`definePageType`/`t`/`arg`, the Zod adapter, the `api`
  types) — **never** `core/wiki.ts`, `command-bus.ts`, `event-log.ts`, or any internal module path.
  A page type ships **no reducer and no renderer** (both engine-owned); it is self-contained and ships
  from its own package: the worked-example types now live in the sibling **`wiki-models`** package
  (`wiki-models/feature`), not in `wiki`.
- **The core is type-agnostic — and owns the fold and the render.** `command-bus.ts`,
  `workspace.ts`, `section-reducer.ts`, and `render/read-model.ts` reach page-type **data** (sections,
  field-kinds, elements, commands, render config) **only** through `registry.ts`; they never name a
  concrete page type and never call model-supplied reducer/render code (the one model fold-seam is a
  bounded `reduceMeta`, §9.5 there). Adding a page type touches only its own bundle plus the
  `pageTypes` array passed to `createWiki` ([§13](#13-worked-example-an-llm-plans-and-ships-a-feature)).
- **CQRS seam — write side ⟂ read model.** `workspace.ts` exports a **public, pure** fold
  (`foldWorkspace`/`applyWorkspace`) so an **external read model** can replay the same way the
  engine does (identical upcasting + unknown-type policy); the default `core/readmodel.ts`
  consumes that fold off the live tail and exposes `IReadModel` (`appliedToken`/`waitFor` +
  token-gated reads). The command bus drives only the **write-side** decide-aggregate; handle
  reads delegate to the read model — neither side imports the other ([§8.6](#86-consistency-tokens-read-models--cqrs)).
- **Pure modules import no I/O** (`guard.ts`, the fold in `workspace.ts`, the section reducer, the
  render read model, `contracts.ts`, `determinism.ts`) — clock and id generation arrive via
  `ICommandContext`, upholding §10/§11 determinism (no `Date.now()`/RNG; ids from injected `newId`).
- **No cycles;** `index.ts` is a leaf that nothing imports internally.

### 16.3 Conventions

- **Interfaces** are `I`-prefixed; type aliases, classes, and functions are not.
- **One page type per file** in a schema bundle (e.g. `wiki-models/src/feature/`); file names kebab-case, matching the `type` tag.
- **Structural events** are PascalCase past-tense (`PageCreated`, `PageReparented`); **content
  events** carry a generic **section operation** (`setField`, `addElement`, …, §8.1.1), attributed to
  the originating **command** in metadata — **commands** are camelCase imperative (`addConstraint`,
  `beginImplementation`).
- A page's **id prefix equals its `type`** (`feature-brief:01J…`) — the type is recoverable from any id.

### 16.4 Dependencies

`wiki/` runtime deps: **`zod`** (+ `zod-to-json-schema`) and **`@durable-streams/client`**
(fetch-based; runs in Node/browser/edge). The default in-memory `IReadModel` (`core/readmodel.ts`,
[§8.6](#86-consistency-tokens-read-models--cqrs)) adds **no** dependency — it folds the live
tail in process; durable/external read models (e.g. a SQL one) live in downstream packages against
the exported `IReadModel` seam. **No FSM dependency** — the guard is ~20 lines in
`core/guard.ts`; `typescript-fsm` is a *design reference only*. **`@durable-streams/server`** is a
**devDependency** (the in-memory `DurableStreamTestServer` used by `testing.ts` and the test suite).
**`wiki-models`** is a **devDependency** — the worked-example page-type bundle (`wiki-models/feature`)
authored against `wiki/authoring`, used by the engine's tests and as the reference schema package; it
is not a runtime dependency of the engine (the engine is schema-agnostic).

## 17. Testing strategy

- **Pure-unit:** the **one section reducer**, the guard, the **render read model**, the field-kind
  ingestion grammar / contracts (§7 there), and **structural invariants** are pure → table-driven
  tests. Key cases: `reparent` cycle rejection, parent-exists, duplicate sibling title, link/`ref`
  integrity, section-set contract, well-formedness, block normal form, `moveItem` atomicity (both the
  `removeElement`+`addElement` ops or neither). Golden render tests are rewritten against the render
  config (greenfield, [ADR-010](../docs/wiki/decision-records/greenfield-no-backward-compatibility.md)).
- **FSM coverage:** for every status, `available()` matches the intended table; property test
  that no command is legal from a status it shouldn't be.
- **Workspace script tests:** a sequence of structural + content mutations produces an expected
  event log *and* expected tree + Markdown. The motivating scenario (create a `feature-brief` → its
  3 children appear atomically → plan/checklist/testing-plan filled → `beginImplementation` blocked
  until the plan has steps → `ship` blocked until the checklist is done, cases pass, and no
  questions are open; plus an atomic cross-page question move) is one script.
- **Concurrency / rebase:** simulate two writers; assert different-page commands both land via
  rebase, and same-page conflicts are correctly rejected by the FSM after rebase.
- **Snapshot round-trip:** fold-from-zero == fold-from-snapshot+tail (byte-identical state).
- **Real (in-memory) store:** one `DurableStreamTestServer` (in-memory) per suite; the bus and
  `EventLog` exercise the *actual* DS code path — no fake to drift from real offset/idempotency/
  precondition/ordering semantics. Fast (localhost) and faithful.
- **Determinism guards:** test that the render read model + the section reducer never import the
  clock or RNG, and that ids come only from injected `newId` (no content-/position-derived ids).
- **LLM-shape tests:** `describeMutations()` emits valid JSON Schema; `availableMutations()` ⊆
  the full command set for the current status.

---

## 18. Future work

- **`wiki-cli/`** — `commander` CLI driven by `describeMutations()` (largely generated):
  `wiki ws create`, `wiki ws <id> page create`, `wiki ws <id> reparent`, `wiki ws <id> render`.
- **`wiki-server/`** — the durable Durable Streams **host** the engine connects to for shared,
  multi-process deployments; specified separately in [`wiki-server/DESIGN.md`](../wiki-server/DESIGN.md).
  (Replaces the former `wiki-api/` idea — the engine needs a stream *host*, not an API wrapper.)
- **Projections / read models** across workspaces — "all open questions," search, dashboards.
- **Branching / forking** a workspace (the event log makes "fork at version N" natural).
- **Soft-delete / trash** flows beyond page-level archival (page archival now ships as a reversible
  visibility flag — [ADR-011](../docs/wiki/decision-records/page-archival-is-an-orthogonal-visibility-flag-not-a-status.md));
  **access control** (actor-scoped command permissions above the FSM).
- **More page types** — Decision Record (ADR), Spec, Risk, Experiment, Meeting.
- **Cross-workspace page move** as an explicit export/import saga.
